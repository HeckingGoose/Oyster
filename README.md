# Oyster

## The Gist

Oyster is an engine-agnostic speech system for in-game dialogue written in C#.

To use Oyster, you will need a DLL from the [releases](https://github.com/HeckingGoose/Oyster/releases) section, along with an implementation for the engine that it is being used with.

## Example implementations

- [Console-based](https://github.com/HeckingGoose/Oyster-ConsoleExample).
